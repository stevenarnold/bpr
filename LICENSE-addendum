LICENSING
=========

This app is licensed under the GPL v3.  Certain additional restrictions given
below also apply, and supercede the GPL v3.  You may contact the original
author, Steven D. Arnold, at stevena+licenses@arnold-software.com, if you wish
to receive a license that differs from this.

"You" are considered to be the person, corporation or other entity, such as
government agency, that is in any way using, copying, modifying, or
distributing this product or any derivative work for any reason whatsoever.

In addition to the restrictions of the GPL v3, if you distribute your
own work based in whole or in part on this code, you may not name your 
product "Blood Pressure Reducer", "BPR", or any derivatives of these 
names such as (for example purposes only) "BPR 2", 
"Better Blood Pressure Reducer", "Blood Pressure Calmer" and the like;
nor may you use these names or derivatives when advertising, promoting, or
otherwise marketing your derivative work.

If you distribute a derivative work of the app to others, you may use any
media resources in the app, such as artwork, sounds, etc, but may not use the
files Icon.png, Icon-72.png, Icon@2x.png, iTunesArtwork.png,
iTunesArtwork@2x.png, or any derivative works, in your distributed
application.

In simple non-lawyer English, the above two paragraphs mean: do not use our
icons or branding; make your own clearly distinctive icons and app name, and
use those.

Having said this, when distributing your code, in a README at the root-level
directory of your project, you must state:

"Parts of this project were contributed by the BPR project at
https://github.com/stevenarnold/bpr, (c) 2013 by Steven Arnold and
Arnold Software Associates." 

We request, but do not require, that you attribute Arnold Software Associates
visibly in your product somewhere in the user interface if your product uses
code or artifacts, such as sounds, from BPR.  The example attribution above
would be ideal, but a shorter attribution is also fine.  A good example
location is an initial splash screen or an "about" section.

You agree that the product comes with no warranty whatsoever, and that you
alone are responsible for all consequences of any use of the product.  You
agree to indemnify and hold harmless Steven D. Arnold and Arnold Software
Associates from the results of any usage of the product or any derivative
created by you.  This is true even if Steven D. Arnold or Arnold Software
Associates knew or should have known about a flaw in the program.  To put it
simply, if you download or use this product in any way, for any reason, the
legal consequences of what happens are entirely yours.

You may only distribute this software or any derivative work provided you pass
along these obligations to the assignee verbatim in writing as part of the
source code distribution.  If these additional conditions  contradict any
terms of the GPL v3, the terms and conditions defined here shall be
considered definitive, and the terms of the GPL v3 shall be modified in the
smallest possible way to allow for this, with the  remainder of the GPL v3
provisions continuing in full force.  Any  violation of the terms of this
license, either the GPL v3 or these additional restrictions, immediately
terminates your license and rights to use, copy or market this product or any
derivative work created with it; however the suspension of your rights does
not invalidate the rights of subassignees, provided they are honoring the
terms of the license.  If your rights are suspended, you must immediately
destroy all copies of the software in your possession, including backup copies
or repository copies.
